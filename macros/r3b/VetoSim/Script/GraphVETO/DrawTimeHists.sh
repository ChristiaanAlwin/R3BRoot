# Now write our information into the graphics source code:
cd ../Source/Graphics/
sed -i "27 a Counter = $1;" ./TimeHists.cpp
sed -i '29 d' ./TimeHists.cpp

# But now we also need to put in the type of series.
# fortunately the analysis has produced a file AnalysisTag.txt
# in the Inputs.root-file which consists of exactly the right number:
cd ../../Data/Inputs/
if [ -f "./AnalysisTag.txt" ]

read Series < ./AnalysisTag.txt
cd ../../Source/Graphics/
sed -i "30 a Series = ${Series};" ./TimeHists.cpp

# And now we can actually run the code:
find ./ -type f ! -name "*.*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
rm -rf ./*.o
cp ../../Compile/Graphics/TimeHists ./Makefile
make clean
make -j 4
./TimeHists
